# Description
- This is a workout log application I developed in JavaScript while taking the course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"
- In development, I built out the functionality of various features as I learned more about OOP with JavaScript, geolocation, and project architecture
- This project demonstrates my newfound understanding of these JavaScript features and my ability to apply them to future projects
